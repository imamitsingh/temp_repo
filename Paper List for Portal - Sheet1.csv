Typically, deep learning networks are trained by randomly selecting samples 
in each mini-batch. By contrast, curriculum learning is a training strategy that aims to boost classifier performance by starting with examples that are easier to classify. Here we define a curriculum to progressively increase the difficulty 
of the training data corresponding to the Hoehn and Yahr (H&Y) staging system for Parkinsons Disease (PD).

We tested combinations of multiple pre-training strategies based on (1) supervised, (2) contrastive learning, and (3) self-supervised learning - using pre-training data within versus outside the MRI domain. In our experiments, the 3D CNN pre-trained with contrastive learning provided the best overall results - when fine-tuned on T1-weighted scans for AD classification - outperformed the baseline by 2.8% when trained with all of the training data from ADNI. We also show test performance as a function of the training dataset size and the chosen pre-training method. Transfer learning offered significant benefits in low data regimes, with a performance boost of 7.7%.

Thompson",Accurate brain age prediction using recurrent slice-based networks,"BrainAge (a subject’s apparent age predicted from neuroimaging data) is an important biomarker of brain aging. The deviation of BrainAge from true age has been associated with psychiatric and neurological disease, and has proven effective in predicting conversion from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to dementia. Conventionally, 3D convolutional neural networks and their variants are used for brain age prediction. However, these networks have a larger number of parameters and take longer to train than their 2D counterparts. Here we propose a 2D slice-based recurrent neural network model, which takes in an ordered sequence of sagittal slices as input to predict the brain age. The model consists of two components: a 2D convolutional neural network (CNN), which encodes the relevant features from the slices, and a recurrent neural network (RNN) that learns the relationship between slices. We compare our method to other recently proposed methods, including 3D deep convolutional regression networks, information theoretic models, and bag-of-features (BoF) models (such as BagNet) - where the classification is based on the occurrences of local features, without taking into consideration their global spatial ordering. In our experiments, our proposed model performs comparably to, or better than, the current state of the art models, with nearly half the number of parameters and a lower convergence time.",Symposium on Medical Information Processing and Analysis(SIPAIM) 2020 ,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.04.235069v1,https://github.com/USC-IGC/RNN_Slice_BrainAge,"Deep learning, Recurrent Neural Networks, Convolutional Neural Networks, Brain Age, Structural Magnetic

Scaling Neuroscience Research Using Federated Learning","The amount of biomedical data continues to grow rapidly. However, the ability to analyze these data is limited due to privacy and regulatory concerns. Machine learning approaches
that require data to be copied to a single location are hampered by the challenges of data sharing. Federated Learning
is a promising approach to learn a joint model over data silos.
This architecture does not share any subject data across sites,
only aggregated parameters, often in encrypted environments,
thus satisfying privacy and regulatory requirements. Here,
we describe our Federated Learning architecture and training
policies. We demonstrate our approach on a brain age prediction model on structural MRI scans distributed across multiple sites with diverse amounts of data and subject (age) distributions. In these heterogeneous environments, our SemiSynchronous protocol provides faster convergence.",IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging(ISBI) 2021,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.08440.pdf,,"Deep Learning, Federated Learning",,Fig. 1 (pg # 2)
"Pradeep Lam, Alyssa H. Zhu, Iyad Ba Gari, Neda Jahanshad, Paul M. Thompson",3D Grid-Attention Networks for Interpretable Age and Alzheimer's Disease Prediction from Structural MRI,"We propose an interpretable 3D Grid-Attention deep neural network that can accurately predict a person's age and whether they have Alzheimer's disease (AD) from a structural brain MRI scan. Building on a 3D convolutional neural network, we added two attention modules at different layers of abstraction, so that features learned are spatially related to the global features for the task. The attention layers allow the network to focus on brain regions relevant to the task, while masking out irrelevant or noisy regions. In evaluations based on 4,561 3-Tesla T1-weighted MRI scans from 4 phases of the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), salience maps for age and AD prediction partially overlapped, but lower-level features overlapped more than higher-level features. The brain age prediction network also distinguished AD and healthy control groups better than another state-of-the-art method. The resulting visual analyses can distinguish interpretable feature patterns that are important for predicting clinical diagnosis. Future work is needed to test performance across scanners and populations.",IEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging(ISBI) 2021,https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.09115,,"Deep learning, computer-aided diagnosis, Alzheimer’s disease, convolutional neural network,

"Umang Gupta, Dimitris Stripelis, Pradeep K. Lam, Paul Thompson, Jose Luis Ambite, Greg Ver Steeg",Membership Inference Attacks on Deep Regression Models for Neuroimaging,"Ensuring the privacy of research participants is vital, even more so in healthcare environments. Deep learning approaches to neuroimaging require large datasets, and this often necessitates sharing data between multiple sites, which is antithetical to the privacy objectives. Federated learning is a commonly proposed solution to this problem. It circumvents the need for data sharing by sharing parameters during the training process. However, we demonstrate that allowing access to parameters may leak private information even if data is never directly shared. In particular, we show that it is possible to infer if a sample was used to train the model given only access to the model prediction (black-box) or access to the model itself (white-box) and some leaked samples from the training data distribution. Such attacks are commonly referred to as \textit{Membership Inference attacks}. We show realistic Membership Inference attacks on deep learning models trained for 3D neuroimaging tasks in a centralized as well as decentralized setup. We demonstrate feasible attacks on brain age prediction models (deep learning models that predict a person's age from their brain MRI scan). We correctly identified whether an MRI scan was used in model training with a 60% to over 80% success rate depending on model complexity and security assumptions.",Medical Imaging with Deep Learning(MIDL) 2021 ,https://openreview.net/forum?id=8lL_y9n-CV,,"brain age, membership inference attacks, privacy, federated-learning",,
"Surabhi Sinhaa , Sophia I. Thomopoulosa , Pradeep Lama , Alexandra Muira , and Paul M. Thompsona",Alzheimer’s Disease Classification Accuracy is Improved by MRI Harmonization based on Attention-Guided Generative Adversarial Networks,"Alzheimer’s disease (AD) accounts for 60% of dementia cases worldwide; patients with the disease typically suffer from irreversible memory loss and progressive decline in multiple cognitive domains. With brain imaging techniques such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), microscopic brain changes are detectable even before abnormal memory loss is detected clinically. Patterns of brain atrophy can be measured using MRI, which gives us an opportunity to facilitate AD detection using image classification techniques. Even so, MRI scanning protocols and scanners differ across studies. The resulting differences in image contrast and signal to noise make it important to train and test classification models on multiple datasets, and to handle shifts in image characteristics across protocols (also known as domain transfer or domain adaptation). Here, we examined whether adversarial domain adaptation can boost the performance of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model designed to classify AD. To test this, we used an Attention-Guided Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to harmonize images from three publicly available brain MRI datasets - ADNI, AIBL and OASIS - adjusting for scanner-dependent effects. Our AG-GAN optimized a joint objective function that included attention loss, pixel loss, cycle-consistency loss and adversarial loss; the model was trained bidirectionally in an end-to-end fashion. For AD classification, we adapted the popular 2D AlexNet CNN to handle 3D images. Classification based on harmonized MR images significantly outperformed classification based on the three datasets in non-harmonized form, motivating further work on image harmonization using adversarial techniques.
